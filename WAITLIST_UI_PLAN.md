# Waitlist UI Overhaul Plan

## Layout Transformation
Transform from conventional centered layout to an asymmetric, premium composition:
- Split-screen aesthetic: minimal left panel with form, expressive right panel with hero content
- Remove visual clutter (emojis, redundant badges, excessive cards)
- Create breathing room with generous whitespace
- Eliminate traditional header/footer chrome

## Visual Hierarchy
- Email input becomes the hero element with minimal surrounding elements
- Typography scale refined for better rhythm
- Success state integrated seamlessly without card containers
- Features presented as subtle metadata, not competing focal points

## Design System Refinement
- Soften shadows for elevated, floating aesthetic
- Introduce subtle accent colors for depth without harshness
- Refine border weights to create delicate separation
- Add sophisticated backdrop blur effects for layered composition

## Result
A waitlist page that feels inevitableâ€”refined, spacious, and premium without artifice.

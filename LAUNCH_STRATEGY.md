## 📝 Launch Messaging

### HackerNews Post Title
**"Show HN: Mixable - Build AI-Native Apps from a Single Prompt (Powered by Mix)"**

### HN Post Body
```
Hi HN!

The world of building apps is changing. Tools like Cursor hit $100M ARR
in 12 months. Gamma went from 60K to 50M users by adding AI. 47 AI-native
apps are now generating $25M+ ARR.

We've been building Mix - a production-ready AI agent SDK with multimodal
capabilities and multi-model routing. But we realized the real pain point:
starting an AI project from scratch is still too hard.

So we built Mixable - think "Lovable for AI-native apps."

**What it does:**
- Describe your AI app in one prompt
- Mixable uses Mix to build it with real AI capabilities
- Get a working app with sessions, streaming, multimodal processing
- Deploy to production

**Demo:**
We have a live demo where you describe an AI app (like "create viral
YouTube shorts") and watch Mixable build it in real-time. Try it and
let us know what you think!

The demo shows a YouTube Shorts generator - paste a video URL, AI analyzes
it with Gemini, identifies viral moments with Claude, and outputs 3
ready-to-post shorts with animations.

**Why this matters:**
Mix gives you production-ready AI infrastructure that competitors don't:
- Cloud-native (not localhost only)
- Multi-model routing (best model per task)
- Multimodal out of box (video, audio, PDF, images)
- Memory-efficient Go backend

We're validating demand before building the full platform. Would you use
this? What AI apps would you build?

### Reddit Post (r/SideProject, r/AI)

**Title:** "Built Mixable: Create AI-native apps from a single prompt. Here's a live demo of building a YouTube shorts generator"

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone! 👋

Been working on Mix (open-source AI agent SDK) and realized something:
even with great AI infrastructure, starting from scratch is still too hard.

**The idea:** What if you could describe an AI app and have it built for you?

**What I built:** Mixable - like Lovable but for AI-native apps

**Live demo:**
I created a working example where you describe "an app that turns YouTube
videos into viral shorts" and Mixable builds it using Mix's multimodal
capabilities.

The demo actually works:
1. Paste any YouTube URL
2. AI analyzes the video (Gemini for vision)
3. Identifies viral-worthy moments (Claude for reasoning)
4. Outputs 3 shorts with animations and captions
5. Ready to post on TikTok/YouTube Shorts

**Why this could matter:**
- AI apps market hitting $26B by 2030
- 47 AI-native companies already at $25M+ ARR
- Cursor hit $100M ARR in 12 months
- But starting an AI project still requires tons of code

**Question for you:**
Would you use this? What AI apps would you build with one prompt?

Let me know what you think!

### Twitter/X Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
The world is changing.

Cursor: $100M ARR in 12 months
Gamma: 60K → 50M users with AI
47 AI-native apps: $25M+ ARR

But starting an AI project still means:
❌ Complex infrastructure
❌ API integrations
❌ Starting from scratch

Until now. 🧵
```

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
```
We built Mix - an open-source AI agent SDK with:
✅ Multimodal (video, audio, PDF)
✅ Multi-model routing
✅ Production-ready infrastructure

But developers still had to code everything.

We needed something faster.
```

**Tweet 3 (Solution):**
```
Introducing Mixable: "Lovable for AI-native apps"

Describe your AI app in one prompt.
Watch it get built in real-time.
Deploy to production.

No code. No starting from scratch.
Just your idea → working AI app.
```

**Tweet 4 (Demo):**
```
Live demo:

Prompt: "Create an app that turns YouTube videos into viral shorts"

Mixable builds:
• Video upload UI

## 💬 FAQ Prep

**Q: Is this actually building the app or is it fake?**
A: This demo is a proof-of-concept to validate the idea. The shorts are pre-created to show what's possible. If there's strong demand, we'll build the real streaming version using Mix.

**Q: How is this different from Lovable?**
A: Lovable builds general apps. Mixable is specifically for AI-NATIVE apps - apps where AI capabilities are core to functionality. We use Mix's multimodal and multi-model routing out of the box.

**Q: Can I actually use this?**
A: We're validating demand first. Join the waitlist and you'll be first to try when we launch.

**Q: What AI apps can I build with Mixable?**
A: Anything AI-native: video analysis tools, code review assistants, document processors, content creators, multimodal search, and more.

**Q: Is Mix open source?**
A: Yes! Mix is MIT licensed: https://github.com/recreate-run/mix

**Q: When will this be available?**
A: Depends on validation. If we get strong interest (100+ waitlist signups), we'll ship in 4-6 weeks.
